- title: "Ultra-Wideband Swarm Ranging"
  image: uwbrange.png
  description: Nowadays, aerial and ground robots, wearable and portable devices are becoming smaller, lighter, cheaper, and thus popular. It is now possible to utilize tens and thousands of them to form a swarm to complete complicated cooperative tasks, such as searching, rescuing, mapping, and battling.

- title: "Looking before Crossing: An Optimal Algorithm to Minimize UAV Energy by Speed Scheduling with a Practical Flight Energy Model"
  image: lookingb4xing.png
  description: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being widely used in wireless communication, e.g., collecting data from ground nodes (GNs), where energy is critical. Existing works combine speed scheduling, i.e., the controlling of speed, with trajectory design for UAVs, making it complicated to solve while loses focus on the fundamental nature of speed scheduling. We focus on speed scheduling by considering straight line flights, with applications in monitoring power transmission lines, roads, water/oil/gas pipes and rivers/coasts.
